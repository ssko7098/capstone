* This week everyone must have a go at annotating the datasets provided by the client and work on a model. 


## Item 2 - What was achieved

* Set up a section in GitHub where the code for model and results can be uploaded. This was required from the client to go onto GitHub, now there is hyperlinks to individal versions of models.
