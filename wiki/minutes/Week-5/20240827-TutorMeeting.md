## Item 1 - (Progress Report) Update given to tutor

* 3 models have now been developed from different sets of data, with accuracy from both just above 70%.

* Client says we are progressing well but its now time to move from researching to actually yielding some results. 

## Item 2 - Challanges, Technical & Requirement Discussion

* Issues with strong compute has hindered our ability to train using ISC. Client has given new SSH method to try access it but is unsuccessful in the interim.

* System for annotating data is really clunky, difficult to use, as well as slow as. Makes it really time consuming and impractical to annotate data.
