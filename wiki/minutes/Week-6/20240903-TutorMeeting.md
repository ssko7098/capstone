## Item 1 - Feedback of Presentation & Demo

* The tutor noted that some slides in our recent presentation were too dense, making it difficult for the audience to digest the information. We were advised to simplify the content and use more visuals to enhance understanding for future tasks.

* The tutor pointed out that there were instances where team members faced away from the audience while presenting, which affected the teams presentability. The tutor recommended maintaining facing the class whilst presenting noting however that it is difficult due to the group size.


## Item 2 - Feedback of Project Progress

* Ã€lthough it is difficult to perform unit test in our project due to its nature, the tutor highlighted the importance of incorporating unit testing within our AI pipeline. Currently, our code lacks unit testing, however the tutor explained we can unit test functions we use such as those within RoboFlow source code even though our group did not write the code. This is to ensure the code we are using works as intended.
