## Unit Testing

This document provides an overview of the unit testing process for our project. The unit testing process is essential for ensuring that the codebase is functioning as expected and that any changes made to the code do not introduce new bugs. The unit testing process involves writing test cases for individual units of code, such as functions or classes, to verify that they produce the expected output.

### Test Plan

Unit testing will be performed on the training of our YOLOv8 models.
