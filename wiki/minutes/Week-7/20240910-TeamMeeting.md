## Item 1 - Next Phase of the Project

Discussed the next phase of the project; training models to detect various PPE on people on construction sites. The client mentioned that we would need to source the data ourselves for this part of the project.

Discussed wriitng an OpenCV script to determine the colour of different hardhats worn on the site instead of labelling the different colours ourselves.

## Item 2 - Weights & Biases

Discussed using Weights & Biases for monitoring the training process and reporting on the different metrics for new models. Everyone needs to make an account and learn how to use it.

## Item 3 - Action Items

Everyone needs to source some datasets for the next training phase of the project. Discussed also training another model before the client deployment which we can use for the next stage of the project.
