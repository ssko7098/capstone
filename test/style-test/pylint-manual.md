# Pylint Manual

## Step 1
Pylint only works on .py files. Since the training scripts are in .ipynb manuals, you must copy and paste the code you would like to test, e.g. 'train.py' in 'yolo-and-isc-manual.ipynb' into a local file on your device. 

## Step 2
Download Pylint using the command 'pip install pylint'

## Step 3
run the command 'pylint mymodule.py', where mymodule.py is the file you copied the training scripts into. Pylint will then produce the results into the terminal and you can asses them from there.
