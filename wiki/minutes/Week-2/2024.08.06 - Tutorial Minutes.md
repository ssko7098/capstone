## Item 6 - Role Allocation / Onboarding Process

Our tutor mentioned that it would be a good idea to swap roles every week so that everyone has a solid understanding of what is expected from them.

## General Business

We have made contact with the client, who has provided us with some tasks to do before the onboarding can take place. We will need to:
1. Join the client discord server for communication.
2. Book our team in ASAP for your onboarding session with Kitt (part of the client's team).
3. Choose a time for our weekly team technical meeting with Cian (the client).

We also discussed what time everyone is available throughout the week for weekly meetings.

Meeting closed at:  08:46 AM
