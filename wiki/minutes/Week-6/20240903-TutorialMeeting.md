## Item 2 - Discussed requirements of deployment

* The team discussed deadlines and the requirements document which our client provided to us. For the demo, the client has suggested to maintain tidyness and structure of code, show all work done up to the presentation and the architecture, meaning what decisions did we make and why. Alongside this, our team will be conducting a code review to another team which will be determined in a later meeting.  


## Item 3 - Discussed using a larger YoloV8 model.

* The final discussion point of the meeting outlined the need of using a larger YoloV8 model, providing our models with a greater sample size with images which we have found online from the previous week. This will be a main focus going forward to improve both accuracy of models and validity of data.
