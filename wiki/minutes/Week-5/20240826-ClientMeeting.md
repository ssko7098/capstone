## Item 1: Q&A

**Question: What can the team do to find more distinct roles**

*Answer: Everyone should be able to train a model. Some members can have a go at training YOLOv10 model instead and assess results to see if the model is better than YOLOv8. Different members can work on different datasets to get a wide range of AI training. We can have decdicated members responsible for augmenting datasets. This includes blurring, flipping rotating, zooming, etc. on images to provide more data to train on. *


**Question: Have other teams got isc working**

*Answer: As far as Cian knows, no other teams have been able to train a model using ISC at this moment. This is something that we look to achieve this week.*


## Item 2: Sprint Plan

| Name | Unikey | Video Link |
|--|--|--|
| Sebastian Skontos | ssko7098 | Create ISC tutorial. Gain metrics relating to the the models detection of safety equipment |
| Daniel Geng | rgen7310 | Train a model on ISC with various datasets, Alter existing datasets to create more data |
| Ryan Tanevski | rtan4242 | Train a model on ISC with various datasets, experiemnt with a YOLOv10 model |
| Dmitry Khachumov | dkha5410 | Train a model on ISC with various datasets, Alter existing datasets to create more data |
| Otavio Pereira Wood | oper7179 | Train a model on ISC with various datasets, Alter existing datasets to create more data |
| Ethan Acevski | eace4343 | Train a model on ISC with various datasets, experiemnt with a YOLOv10 model |
| Nicko Heberden | nheb2621 | Train a model on ISC with various datasets, Gain metrics relating to the the models detection of safety equipment |

## Item 3 - General Business

* Annotating the live public data sets is not a priority for our team, as we are focusing more on the clothing and gear rather than the cosntruction site as a whole.

* Look into getting our own annotations and data for images with construction gear.

* By Wednesday Cian would like trained models going able to identify people. We must gain some data relating to safety equipment metrics.

* Look at model outputs to see if more training can make the model better. If so, train more. Send charts and outputs to isc chat so the technical can identify this if we are struggling.
