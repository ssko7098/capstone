## Item 1: Q&A

**Question: Should each member train on their own model or use a shared dataset**

*Answer: Use the same dataset but keep adding data each time. Generally want to mix the data into one model Would be interesting to see individual results however.*


**Question: What goes in GitHub**

*Answer: Code, documentation, research. Don't put large files (e.g. dataset, model weights). The code we use to train the model. Put the model weight file on sharepoint/OneDrive.*


## Item 2: Sprint Plan

| Name | Unikey | Video Link |
|--|--|--|
| Sebastian Skontos | ssko7098 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |
| Daniel Geng | rgen7310 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |
| Ryan Tanevski | rtan4242 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |
| Dmitry Khachumov | dkha5410 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |
| Otavio Pereira Wood | oper7179 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |
| Ethan Acevski | eace4343 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |
| Nicko Heberden | nheb2621 | Find more public datasets while we wait for Compute resources, training models when the Compute is unlocked. |

## Item 3 - General Business

* Please make sure you have the GitHub rules in place for protecting main
* Remember to create a branch, open a Pull Request (PR) and merge it to main after a review is complete
* Add a .gitignore that prevents images and datasets getting into GitHub, along with those pesky .DS_Store files from macs.

* Remember: Put individual names on sprint plan to make it more specific
* Data labelling: Lable people. When we do an extraction of this dataset, we will have a dataset of people. It won't be labelled with the classes we have in the confusion matrix. We want to know how that data performs when we get a copy of it.
* Use the Compute resources and start training models. Strong ISC: where questions about Compute can be asked.
