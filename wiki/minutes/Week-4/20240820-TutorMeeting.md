## Item 1 - (Progress Report) Update given to tutor

* 2 models have been developed from different sets of data, with accuracy from both just above 70%.

* The client has provided strong compute resources to make training more efficient, this will be used with the models during the week.

* Client says we are progressing really well and should keep feeding data to models

## Item 2 - Challanges, Technical & Requirement Discussion

* questions surrounding how the models react to different datasets such as those with low vs high resolution. Josh suggested different models can be made for different data sets, this is a question that will needed to be brought up with the client
