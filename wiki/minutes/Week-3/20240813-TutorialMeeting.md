## Item 1 - Objective of meeting

* Meeting was called to touch base regarding what is required for the upcoming week. This is vital as we want to finish our preparation before the client provides us with resources regarding training our models.

Specific work that is required for the upcoming week includes:
* Get BitBucket synced up with GitHub so that we only have to make one push each time.
* Get the YOLOv8 models downloaded and start testing them out.


## Item 2 - What was achieved

* Set up team GitHub as required by the client. We formatted our Wiki and have included minute templates.

* 5/7 members have started the Udacity course as provided by the client.

* All communications/project management platforms are set up, with automations integrated to Slack.
