  ISC held up progress.

* As per below, each of the 3 team has been allocated with different tasks that
  need to be completed over the following weeks. 

## Item 2 - What was achieved

* Model was being pushed to Strong Compute, however issues were faced when
  attempting to run the model due to some YOLO incompatability issues. Has now
  been made a priority for the following week.

* Team successfully allocated a minimum of an hour on annotatingthe dataset from 18th of August Enlaps B - Scaled Resolution/YOLO ready (1024x1024)datasets 


## Item 3 - Discuss actioned items from Client

* Roles mentioned in the client meeting were allocated to group members,
  resulting in the following teams:
* **Data Research Team**:
    - Members: Ethan and Dim
    - Aim: Researching new data sets, collating new data, and labeling for
      clothing and people on new datasets.

* **Training and Analysing Results**:
    - Members: Sebastian, Nicko and Dainel:
    - Aim: Analysing the current training model reuslts, researching
      opportunties for model accuracy improvement, and working on successfully
      getting models running on Strong Compute.

* **Data Team**:
    - Members: Ryan and Otavio
    - Aim: Augmenting the existing data in order to increase the training
      dataset for models.
